            <p>Hello, my name is Blake! I have been programing 7 years and love it even more than when I started. I like 3d-printing, arduinos, and just chilling with my fellow club members. I am a python and chrome extensions
          developer, as well as a laser eltromagentic visualizer engineer. I love checking out and helping people with their projects. If you want to ask questions about the club or want someone to hang out with, hit me up!

            <p>Hello, my name is John, and I’m 15. Besides programming with fellow Memphis HackClubbers, I also enjoy playing video games, especially Minecraft and Nintendo games, collecting Lego, playing soccer and watching shows with my siblings. I’ve been programming for around 5 years now, and have loved the projects we do here at Memphis Hack Club. I’ve developed my own video game an RPG about exploring the forest as teenage boy. I am an avid pianist and guitar guru. I’m a musical composer, and I also run a gaming YouTube channel. I am very proud to be a part of the team here at Memphis Hack Club and would love to meet you. I am happy to answer any questions and introduce you into Memphis HackClub, so please email or text me.

<h1 class="welcome">What Will The Class Look Like?</h1>
      <p>Students will participate in weekly class workshops, taught by <b>Memphis HackClub</b>. These workshops are free and open to anyone <i>(including those not taking the course)</i> and will cover all the programming concepts mentioned above through interactive and fun projects. 
<br><br>
Students will be assigned lessons from the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/ap-computer-science-principles">“AP Computer Science Principle”</a> created by Khan Academy in between class days to continue to grow on these concepts. Leaders fromMemphis HackClub will check in on each student to make sure their course is going well, and assist whenever the student needs it. 
<br><br>
Throughout each semester, students will identify and then solve a real-world problem with code. These <b>“Personal Projects”</b> will be presented at the end of each semester, as well as a walkthrough on how it works. Personal Projects are great ways to show colleges or future employers your creative problem skills and ways of thinking through issues logically.
