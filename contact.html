            <p>Hi, I'm Micah!  I'm a graphic designer and web developer who's been coding for nearly eight years now!  I started programming on Scratch in 2014 and now I spend most of my time building stuff in Vue 3, Ionic, JavaScript, and more.  Memphis Hack Club added me to their team during late 2021, but I'm very enthusiastic about young coders and love teaching workshops.

            <p>Hello, I'm Lilly! I've been coding here and there for about 2 years now and am excited to learn and grow. I code websites in HTML and Roblox games in Lua. Other than coding I enjoy video design, theater, and goofing off with my friends. I'm so glad I found Memphis HackClub because it's taught me more about coding and I've made great friends in the process.
