      <p>
        At Memphis Hack Club, we are a welcoming community of fellow makers, future engineers, and fantastic computer scientists! You should not hesitate to join us for one of our weekly meetings no matter your skill level. Itâ€™s
        absolutely fine if you have never done any coding or engineering before. Our members will help walk you through the learning process. Our weekly meetings will allow you to make your first project in less than one and
        half hours. Probably the most important benefit is being around students who share your interest in technology. Hack Club is an amazing social experience filled with much fun and some learning! Our Weekly Zoom Meetings
        are every Friday at 4:00 PM where we host amazing workshops. We also have a Discord where we host gaming nights, special coding events, and art socials. At your meeting, we will invite you to the discord, but please
        read the security and code of conduct below.
